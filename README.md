## How to Use Downloady

1. **Enter the file URL** in the text field.
2. **Click "Download"** and choose where to save the file.
3. **Wait for the download to complete.**

## Using Extensions
Extensions are Python scripts that extend Downloady's functionalities.

### Installing an Extension
To use an extension, pass its path to the `Downloady` command:
```sh
Downloady -e extensions\ytube.py
```
**Note:** If the path contains spaces, enclose it in quotes.

### Creating Your Own Extension
An extension is a simple Python script that must implement the function:
```python
def process_download(url, save_path, progress_callback):
    # Code to handle the custom download
```
And must contain these variables:
```python
Name = ["Extension Name"]
Devs = ["Your Name"]
```
Save the file with a `.py` extension and load it with the `Downloady -e` command.

## Troubleshooting
- **Downloady is not recognized in the terminal**
  - Ensure you have run `python main.py` at least once.
  - Restart the terminal to apply `PATH` changes.
  - Check with `echo %PATH%` if the Downloady folder is present.

- **The extension does not load**
  - Make sure the file is a valid `.py` script.
  - Ensure the file contains the `process_download` function.
  - Run with `Downloady -e "path\to\extension.py"`.
